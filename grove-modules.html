Grove Base Shield

The <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html">Grove Base Shield (V2)</a> connects your Arduino board to the other Grove modules. It has different kinds of connections:

A0, A1, A2, A3: these are analog inputs that can read from sensors like the light sensor, temperature sensor, and rotation knob.

D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8: these are digital connections that can control things like LEDs and servo motors and read from push buttons. If you want to fade an LED (not just turn it on and off), you have to use D3, D5, or D6.

I2C and UART: these are more complex connections that we don't use in the extension yet.

To connect a module to the shield, plug one of the Grove cables into the white connector on the module and one of the connectors on the shield. The cable only goes into the connector one way.
